\addblocktext{Summary}{%
I am a computer science student and former Art student.
I have worked on all kinds of things including 2D and 3D games, game engines, rendering engines, GPGPU, command line applications, open source libraries, android apps, data processing tools, experimental prototypes, interactive electronic devices, AI's and procedural generated content.
I care about combining art and programming and I support the philosophy, use and development of free open source software.

    \explanation{Software Engineer}
    \explanationdetail{\coloredbullet\ %
     Utrecht Companion to the earth is an app that has the goal to aid Geo-science students. Our client for the project was the Geo-science department of Utrecht University. My responsibility was optimizing large amounts of data for mobile use and building the Android app. Technologies used by me were Rust and Kotlin with Android Studio. I learned about building Android apps, Shapefile and KML files, compression and the Geo-science field.

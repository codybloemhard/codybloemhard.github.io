                    <section>
                        I have enjoyed programming since i was young.
                        I used to make games in my free time.
                        I studied Game Development at the University of the Arts Utrecht (HKU)
                        for a year before i decided to study Computer Science at Utrecht University.
                        I have worked on all kinds of things including 2D and 3D games, game engines,
                        rendering engines, GPGPU, command line applications, open source libraries,
                        android apps, data processing tools, experimental prototypes,
                        interactive electronic devices, AI's,
                        procedural generated content, audio applications
                        and algorithmic composition.
                        I care about combining art and programming and I support the philosophy,
                        use and development of free open source software.
                        My preferred programming language is Rust.

                            It supports features including top level BVH's with binning and SAH,
                            raytracing, pathtracing, tone mapping and microfacet materials:
                            GGX-Smith conductors/dielectrics, GGX NDF importance sampling.

                        <p>
                            Utrecht Companion to the earth is an app that has the goal to aid
                            Geo-science students. Our client for the projectwas the Geo-science
                            department of Utrecht University.
                            My responsibility was optimizing large amounts of data for mobile use
                            and building the Android app.
                            Technologies used by me were Rust and Kotlin with Android Studio.
                            I learned about building Android apps, Shapefile and KML files,
                            compression and the Geo-science field.
                            As well as other skills such as managing a sub team and it's git repo.

                            A tool to help you create a good overview of your deadlines, todos,
                            ideas, events, etc. I chose TUI over GUI, because it deals mostly
                            with text, and the terminal is perfect for text.
                            Also it is low effort to use as the terminal is always close to you.

                            It features the classic pacman gamemode, menus and highscores.
                            We tried to stay as close as possible to the original game with the

                            as they are in real life. It has a dynamic LOD that is mulithreaded.
                            It has a grass biome, a snow biome and a desert biome.
                            There are also generated 3D models placed around the terrain,
                            following the player.

                            It has elements of cycling through the city, the grey communist
                            era buildings, the old airport and traveling using the metro.

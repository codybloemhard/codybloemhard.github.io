                    <section>
I have enjoyed programming since i was young.
I used to make games in my free time.
I studied Game Development at the University of the Arts Utrecht (HKU)
for a year before i decided to study Computer Science at Utrecht University.
I have worked on all kinds of things including 2D and 3D games, game engines,
rendering engines, GPGPU, command line applications, open source libraries,
parsers, transpilers, core OS interface components,
android apps, data processing tools, experimental prototypes,
interactive electronic devices, AI's,
procedural generated content, audio applications
and algorithmic composition.
I care about combining art and programming and I support the philosophy,
use and development of free open and source software.
My preferred programming language is Rust.

                            The major components are ringwm, dmenu, shapebar and st.
                            Programs such as St, Dmenu, shapebar have patches applied and code edited.
                            Ringwm is a bespoke window manager I wrote in rust
                            (see <a href="#ringwm">ringwm</a>).
                            It supports live theme switching.

                            Ringwm in based on rings and super swallowing.
                            The screen is split up in to at most two columns; in contrast with other
                            window managers. Each column is a ring of windows.
                            New windows are placed in a ring and swallow the previous window on top.
                            The goal is to be so efficient you only need a few columns and to
                            give windows room to work with.

                            It works with a plain text transactional database.
                            It tracks worth of accounts, distribution of assets and statistics
                            such as net worth, yield, receiving and spending.
                            It can produce a summary of accounts, assets and some lookahead metrics
                            as well as a graph plotting values over time.

                        <p>
                            Utrecht Companion to the earth is an app that has the goal to aid
                            Geo-science students. Our client for the project was the Geo-science
                            department of Utrecht University.
                            My responsibility was optimizing large amounts of data for mobile use
                            and building the Android app.
                            Technologies used by me were Rust and Kotlin with Android Studio.
                            I learned about building Android apps, Shapefile and KML files,
                            compression and the Geo-science field.
                            As well as other skills such as managing a sub team and it's git repo.

                            A tool to help you create a good overview of your deadlines, todos,
                            ideas, events, etc. I chose TUI over GUI, because it deals mostly
                            with text, and the terminal is perfect for text.
                            Also it is low effort to use as the terminal is always close to you.

                            I made this with Ilse Bigler, Tariq Bakhtali and Bastiaan Burghardt.
                            We went to Berlin and modeled the virtual world to reflect our experience.
                            It has elements of cycling through the city, the grey communist
                            era buildings, the old airport and traveling using the metro.
                            Source has been lost, only binaries for windows exist.

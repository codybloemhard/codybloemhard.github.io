<h1>On enumerated file names</h1>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Sometimes I want files to have an order, like images for example. I will preface the file name with a number e.g. <code>0-bug.png</code>, <code>1-fixed.png</code>.
But this breaks when you go over 9:</p>
<pre><code>0-spheres.png                              18-brightness-illusion.png
1-bug.png                                  2-spheres-aa4.png
10-whitted.png                             3-bug.png
11-gpu-tris-bug.png                        4-float-addition-bug.png
12-gpu-pathtracing-skylight.png            5-float-addition-bug.png
13-absorption-dielectrics-path-gpu.png     6-float-addition-bug.png
14-diamond-teapot-gpu-path.png             7-float-addition-bug.png
15-1B-tris-10k-water-dragons.png           8-float-addition-bug.png
16-bright-sky-rough-copper.png             9-float-addition-bug.png
17-linear-aces-hable-tonemapping-test.png
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Now I try out switching from team numeric to team alpha:</p>
<pre><code>a-spheres.png             h-float-addition-bug.png               o-diamond-teapot-gpu-path.png
b-bug.png                 i-float-addition-bug.png               p-1B-tris-10k-water-dragons.png
c-spheres-aa4.png         j-float-addition-bug.png               q-bright-sky-rough-copper.png
d-bug.png                 k-whitted.png                          r-linear-aces-hable-tonemapping-test.png
e-float-addition-bug.png  l-gpu-tris-bug.png                     s-brightness-illusion.png
f-float-addition-bug.png  m-gpu-pathtracing-skylight.png
g-float-addition-bug.png  n-absorption-dielectrics-path-gpu.png
</code></pre>
<p>It works, it sorts correctly.
But I already have problems doing it correctly because I don't know the successor of a letter in the alphabeth from the top of my head, because I'm a dumbass.
I will try upgrading my brain with the <code>git gud</code> strategy.</p>

<h1>Problems using a different captive portal to avoid connectivitycheck.gstatic.com tracking</h1>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Everytime you connect your phone to a network you android device will ping <code>connectivitycheck.gstatic.com</code> to see if it has internet access, if not it will launch the captive portal.
In order not to ping the google service every time you connect one can venture to change the settings.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Following mental outlaw's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1U5qoiR1fM">tutorial</a>, i changed the captive portal url's:</p>
<pre><code>adb devices
adb root
adb remount
adb shell &quot;settings put global captive_portal_http_url http://204.ecloud.global&quot;
adb shell &quot;settings put global captive_portal_https_url https://e.foundation/net_204/&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This works.
After this the captive portal server seems to be null:</p>
<pre><code>adb shell &quot;settings get global captive_portal_server&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>As I understand it this is what to ping to check connectivity?
Anyway, I changed it to my own website:</p>
<pre><code>adb shell &quot;settings put global captive_portal_server codyb.xyz&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Which seems to work too.
This minor change does not alter any of the symptoms following.</p>
<h2>Problems, continued</h2>
<p>I connect to my home wifi, and the internet access works.
There are two problems, a very minor one and a bit more annoying one:</p>
<ul>
<li>It tells you <code>&quot;name_of_wifi&quot; has limited connectivity</code>. However, the internet works fine.</li>
<li>(fixed, i was dumb, you need to confirm something on the popup (also forgot what(very clear post this(again to many nested items)))) It will disconnect often, so you will need to reconnect everytime you need to do something that requires internet connection.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Ballistic Overkill 1000 games achievement speed up</h1>
<h2>What</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/296300/Ballistic_Overkill/">Ballistic Overkill</a>(BO) is a fps game on steam of which I used to play the free web version on Kongregate a long fkn time ago.
I had all <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/296300/achievements">achievements</a> except <code>The stuff I've seen...</code> which is the one you get for playing a thousand matches.
It was a bit scuffed since it started counting after I started playing, if I can remember correctly.
But somehow after this process of getting it the ingame count of matches played is less than 1000.
I didn't feel like playing 500+ matches so I decided to cheat a little bit (it won't affect other players).</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>Set up your own dedicated BO server with some changed settings so matches go by quickly.
Example code is for Arch based distro's.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install steam and install the game within steam:
<ul>
<li><code>sudo pacman -S steam</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install steamcmd with your AUR helper of choice:
<ul>
<li><code>paru steamcmd</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install the BO game server with steamcmd:
<ul>
<li><code>steamcmd +login anonymous +force_install_dir server +app_update 416880 validate +quit</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Move into the server directory:
<ul>
<li><code>cd .steam/steamcmd/server</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run the server:
<ul>
<li><code>./BODS.x86 -batchmode -nographics -logfile output.txt</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will get you a regular working server you can play on.
For this trick you don't need to host it on a real server, just run the server locally on your machine and than play the game, connect to your own server.
The above steps were taken from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/296300/discussions/1/135508662495143639">this steam community discussions thread</a>.</p>
<p>To get the benefits, you need to change the settings in <code>config.txt</code>.
Firstly we can set the match time to 1 minute so the matches go by much faster: <code>MatchTime=1</code>.
The rounds gamemode has it's own parameters: <code>Rounds=1</code>, <code>RoundTime=30</code> to have one quick 30 sec round with default 26 second warm up, summing to aprox. a minute.
When playing, you need to join the leaderboard so just spawn in and do nothing. The inactivity timeout will not kick in within the short matches timespan.
With this method every round takes <code>40 + match_time_in_seconds + loading_time</code> seconds. You will need to load the maps and the lobby with next match vote takes 40 seconds.
You don't need to click to vote, it will just pick a random map and go.</p>
<p>To go faster, we can set <code>WarmUpTime=0</code>. This is the warmup time for rounds gamemode.
It won't work properly, making it skip the the whole match. However, it will count towards the achievement.
So effectively the match itself takes 0 seconds now, leaving <code>40 + loading_time</code> seconds a 'match'.
For this you will need to vote for rounds gamemode to ensure you will get this optimal match everytime.</p>
<p>Here follows the complete <code>config.txt</code> that will work for this task. The <code>OwnerId</code> is set to mine so if I get into your server it's mine :)</p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to complete the game</li>
<li>One should not waste sigificant amounts of time increasing arbitrary counters online
<ul>
<li>Ironic since it still took like 6 hours to get done
<ul>
<li>But you can do other things while doing it
<ul>
<li>Only idiots write this much nested bulletpoints</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No other players are affected, just set a password and do your thing in isolation</li>
<li>Why not</li>
</ul>
